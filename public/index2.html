          She was beautiful, for the way she thought. She was beautiful, for the
          sparkle in her eyes when she talked about something she loved. She was
          beautiful, for her ability to make other people smile, even if she was
          sad. No, she wasn't beautiful for something as temporary as her looks.
          She was beautiful, deep down to her soul. She is beautiful.
